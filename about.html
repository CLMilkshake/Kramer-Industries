            <h2 style="font-size:20px; margin:20px; text-align: justify;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kramer Industries has a very humble beginning. The idea behind the company started when a Mr Jacob Kramer was just 16. He had a knack for engineering and design, and during his High School years, among other projects such as robots and video-games, he created his own OS system. Because of his success in this field, he skipped college in favor of learning engineering for himself. He worked on a few more projects during his early 20s, and even found love in his old classmate, Ms Elaine Gelone.</h2>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px; margin:2%; text-align: left;">Eventually, he founded Kramer Industries in 2071. He founded the company on the idea that the Technology and Science we had could be furthered by the right people. He invited his best friend from High School, Mr Henry Karsh, to join him in his pursuit. They worked together for many years, innovating the world with things such as the Kramer PC, KVR Headset, and even their own cookies, but Mr Kramer tragically died before he could initiate his biggest project yet, "Project Intus". Now run by Mr Henry Karsh, Kramer Industries is continuously furthering science and technology as we know it while inspiring the next generation through its youth programs.</h2>
            <h2 style="font-size:20px; margin:4%; text-align: left;">We have many programs that encourage the youth of our days to get out and change the world, but our most popular is The Creativity Fair, where youth can create whatever they want and share it with their school, and vote on which project they liked most. The winner of that vote gets to meet Mr Karsh, and could get their project funded!</h2>
            <h2 style="font-size:20px; margin:4%; text-align: left;">Kramer Industries has only been a company for 13 years, but its roots have been around for much longer. We don't forget our roots and who got us to the place we are today, you. That's why we always put the consumer first, and why we have been the best tech company these past few years. We hope you continue to stay with us as we continue our journey to prepare the future.</h2>
